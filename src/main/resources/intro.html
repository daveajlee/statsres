<p>Statsres is a small software utility for calculating statistical measurements from a results dataset. The purpose of Statsres is to aid the user in the collection of these statistical measurements by calculating several measurements for a single dataset during a single run. Statsres's output can then be copied into any application for presentation or further analysis.</p>
